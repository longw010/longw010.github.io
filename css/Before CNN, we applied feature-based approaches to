Before CNN, we applied feature-based approaches to activity recognition, more precisely, dense trajectories

detect the key points in the images
tracing the keypoints across the video
basically three steps;
1. detect feature points at different scales
2. track features with optical flow
3. extract HOG/HOF/MSH features in the stabilized coordinate system of each tracklet
