### CHANGELOG

[TODO]
make the page modulable.
- reproduce 50 articles at Github and write blogs for the problems I met; also updated at Medium

- try more great tools and wrote blogs about user experiments on that

- make notes on interesting pre/post/training tricks from kaggle and write blogs on that

- keep notes on the common tips (problem and how to solve it) as QA/How-to at SNIPPET

[Unreleased]
v20180512
- Add gitment comment systems for each blog

- Note that id is set as DDMMYYYY. When there are multiple blogs in the same day(very unlikely for me), set as v1, v2, v3. Check out more details here.

v20171210
- Using Github as a Syntax Highlighter for Your Blog or Website
